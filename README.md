This course consists of a quarter-long project which requires application of the data science knowledge and skills acquired through the OMDS curriculum. Students will pick one project out of several available options, each project from a different application domain. Projects are individually completed and graded based on a 10-step process translated into executable notebook-based reports throughout.
